Utilizing your current skills and the desire to learn new ones, the aim of the Single Page Project is to create something challenging. What you choose to build and add to the community gallery of single page projects is entirely upto you. You can build anything such as a portfolio template, a landing page, a fan page, a mini game (such as Pairs, Hangman, snake etc), a calculator, a quiz, name generator, color picker, todo list. 

The project you build can be as simple or as complex as you like, so this challenge is suitable for students of all stages of their learning journey. If you are currently learning HTML and CSS, you can build a landing/fan/portfolio type page using everything you have learnt about HTML and CSS so far. Or if you are jumping into the JavaScript section you can try your hand and making a mini game or quality of life tool such as a calculator or todo list. Be sure to conform to the rules laid out below though. 


## The Rules
The rules are simple:
- The code you write must be your own. Using articles and resources to guide you is fine, but copy and pasting large chunks of code will not help imporve your skills.
- All your code **MUST** be written in a single HTML file **within** the submissions directory of this repo.
- You **cannot** utilize any external resources such as API's, Images, Libraries etc
- Push your boundaries, try something new or add a twist.

## The Submission Process:
> If you've never forked a repository or made a pull request before, we recommend making your first one over at [https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines). That will count towards your total, and then you'll be ready to take on this challenge with your new GitHub skills!
> 
> A cool resource to learn about the fork workflow can also be found here - [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)

Now, once you've forked this repo and got a local version up on your computer, follow these steps:

1. In the `Submissions` directory, create a **HTML** file using your Github username as the filename.
2. Using only this HTML file create your project! It can be as simple or as complex as you like. This file should contain all your HTML, CSS & JS
3. In the submissions section below, add the details of your submission, using the following example as a guide.
    `- [PROJECT TITLE](SUBMISSION URL) - By: [YOUR NAME](YOUR GH URL)`

## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all ZTM challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain ZTM receives from it. This is just our way of thanking students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just the course videos. It would mean a lot to us if you are able to rate the course(s) you are taking...5 star reviews makes Andrei's day :)**
